SixArm.com » Postfix » Main configuration file, main.cf

This is our Postfix main configuration file,
which we put on servers in /etc/postfix/main.cf

The file has some settings that are specific to our servers;
to make it work on your own servers, you can customize these.

We typically install postfix checks using our repo sixarm_postfix_checks
